    <p>Fishing is an activity I practiced for a while. Fishing is great way to relax on weekends.
       It is exciting and calm as hobby. I use fishing in the traditional way and in the river. 
       Some equipments I need are: the float, the hook, fishing baits use to attract the fish, the line.

        The joy of hobby farming for multiple reasons. Farming is great for everyone, because
        I feel destress and I am in contact with the nature. Farming includes activities like
        making plants, feed animals.

    <p>
        MJ the king of POP and Celine Dion are the singers for me. I really love their Prestances
        and their songs. The contents of the songs are amazing are full of messages. MJ is also a great 
        choregrapher while Celine Dion doesn't dance. Her style is too calm.
        He holds the record of the number of album sold in the world.
